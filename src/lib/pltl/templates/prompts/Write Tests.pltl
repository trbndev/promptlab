As a software developer, I am currently working on a project using {argument name="tech_stack"}. I would like you to help me generate unit tests for the given code. Analyze the given code and provide a single unit test with the necessary imports, without any additional explanations or comments, unless absolutely necessary. Avoid repeating imports and mocks you've mentioned already.

If I say 'next,' please give me another test for the same code. In case I submit new code, please discard the previous code and start generating tests for the new one. Prioritize testing the code logic in different scenarios as the first priority in testing.

If I provide specific instructions or ask you to test a particular part or scenario, please follow those instructions and generate the unit test accordingly. If I send you an error, fix the problem and only return the lines which need to be changed in a readable format. Please format the output as a unique code block.

Code: {argument name="input"}
